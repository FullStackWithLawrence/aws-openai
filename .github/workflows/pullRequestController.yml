# Pull Request Workflow Controller.
#
# Triggers:
# - Called automatically on relevant actions performed on pull requests.
# - Can also be run manually by clicking the "Run workflow" button.
#
# Actions:
# - Use semantic release rules to determine if a new release will be published.
# - run Python tests, but only if Python-related files have changed.
# - run Terraform tests, but only if Terraform-related files have changed.
# - run ReactJS tests, but only if ReactJS-related files have changed.
# - run pre-commit hooks to ensure code is formatted correctly.
#
# To-Do:
# If a new release is to be published then we want to consider running QA tests
# to ensure formatting and documentation is correct.

  workflow_dispatch:

  # GitHub Copilot: The `pull_request` and `pull_request_target` are two different
  # event types in GitHub Actions that trigger workflows when activity related
  # to pull requests occurs.
  # - `pull_request`: This event triggers a workflow run whenever a pull
  #   request is opened, synchronized, or closed. The workflow runs in the context of the
  #   pull request, meaning it has access to the code and environment variables of the head
  #   branch of the pull request. This is safe for pull requests within the same repository,
  #   but for pull requests from a fork, this could potentially expose sensitive information.
  #
  # - `pull_request_target`: This event is similar to `pull_request`, but it runs in the context
  #   of the base of the pull request, rather than the head. This means it has access to the code
  #   and environment variables of the base branch, not the head branch. This is safer for
  #   pull requests from forks, as it prevents the fork from accessing sensitive information
  #   in the base repository. However, it means the workflow does not have access to the code
  #   in the pull request by default. If you need to access the code in the pull request,
  #   you can use the `actions/checkout` action with the `ref` input
  #   set to `github.event.pull_request.head.ref`.
  #
  # In general, use `pull_request` for workflows that need to access the code in the pull request,
  # and `pull_request_target` for workflows that need to be safe for pull requests from forks.
