# OpenAI Code Samples

A [React](https://react.dev/) + [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) full stack implementation of the [30 example applications](https://platform.openai.com/examples) found in the official OpenAI API documentation.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: AWS' Lambda service has a hard 29-second timeout. OpenAI API calls often take longer than this, in which case the AWS API Gateway endpoint will return a 504 "Gateway timeout error" response to the React client. This happens frequently with apps created using chatgpt-4. Each of the 30 OpenAI API example applications are nonetheless implemented exactly as they are specified in the official documentation.**

## ReactJS chat application

Complete documentation is located [here](./client/).

React app that leverages [Vite.js](https://github.com/FullStackWithLawrence/aws-openai), [@chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react), and [react-pro-sidebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pro-sidebar).

### Key features

- robust, highly customizable chat features
- A component model for implementing your own highly personalized OpenAI apps
- Skinnable UI for each app
- Includes default assets for each app
- Small compact code base
- Robust error handling for non-200 response codes from the custom REST API
- Handles direct text input as well as file attachments
- Info link to the OpenAI API official code sample
- Build-deploy managed with Vite

## Custom OpenAI REST API Backend

Complete documentation is located [here](./api/).

A Terraform-installed AWS Serverless REST API implementing each of the [30 example applications](https://platform.openai.com/examples) from the official [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests?lang=python) using a modularized Terraform approach. Implemented as a serverless microservice using AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and the [OpenAI Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/). Leverages OpenAI's suite of AI models, including [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4), [DALLÂ·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e), [Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper), [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings), and [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/moderation).

- Creating new OpenAI applications and endpoints for this API only takes a few lines of code and is as easy as it is fun! Follow [this link](./terraform/apigateway_endpoints.tf) to see how each of these are coded.
- **Follow [this link](./doc/examples/README.md) for detailed documentation on each URL endpoint.**

### Key features

- Fully automated and [parameterized](./api/terraform/terraform.tfvars) Terraform build
- well documented code plus supplemental [documentation resources](./doc/)
- Low-cost [AWS serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) implementation using [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/); free or nearly free in most cases
- Robust, performant and infinitely scalable
- Fast build time; usually less than 60 seconds to fully implement
- Includes both Python and Node.js Lambda examples
- Deploy https to a custom domain
- Preconfigured [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) files for testing
- includes AWS API Gateway usage policy and api key
- Full CORS configuration

## Requirements

- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
