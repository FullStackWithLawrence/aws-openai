## Custom OpenAI REST API Backend

A REST API implementing each of the [30 example applications](https://platform.openai.com/examples) from the official [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests?lang=python) using a modularized Terraform approach. Implemented as a serverless microservice using AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and the [OpenAI Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/). Leverages OpenAI's suite of AI models, including [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4), [DALLÂ·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e), [Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper), [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings), and [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/moderation).

- Creating new OpenAI applications and endpoints for this API only takes a few lines of code and is as easy as it is fun! Follow [this link](./terraform/apigateway_endpoints.tf) to see how each of these are coded.
- **Follow [this link](./doc/examples/README.md) for detailed documentation on each URL endpoint.**
