          Come away with a strategy to add AI to your own real-world project and learn how to assess and select the right infrastructure for high-performance and low-cost instances optimized for Machine Learning.
          You’ll also be encouraged to upskill with additional online training and hands-on tutorials through freely available resources.
          Technical and coding skills are not required to take this course. It is designed to accommodate professionals in non-technical or tech-adjacent roles.
